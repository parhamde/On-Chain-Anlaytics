# Project Title: Bitcoin Price Prediction using On-Chain Analytics and Machine Learning Models

## Introduction

Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that utilizes encryption and a decentralized system to validate transactions and maintain records, eliminating the need for a central authority. The cryptocurrency market has grown significantly since its inception in 2008, with over 20,000 cryptocurrencies and a total market capitalization of over $850 billion as of December 2022. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT) are some of the most popular cryptocurrencies based on their prices and market demand. 

While cryptocurrencies share some similarities with stocks, their unique features, characteristics, and structures make them distinct. As a result, analyzing cryptocurrencies using traditional stock market methods may not be entirely accurate. On-Chain analysis has emerged as the preferred approach for understanding and predicting cryptocurrency market behavior. On-Chain metrics involve examining transaction data on a specific blockchain network that is publicly accessible. On-Chain analytics is a field of study that analyzes transaction activity and the utility of cryptocurrency and blockchain data. It provides valuable insights into the cryptocurrency market and complements traditional analysis methods.

In this project, we have implemented four machine learning models, namely LSTM, GRU, RNN, and CNN, to predict the price of Bitcoin. Additionally, we have conducted research on various On-Chain data and investigated correlations to determine which data variables are better suited for Bitcoin price prediction. We aim to compare the predictive performance of On-Chain data against traditional price data using our machine learning models.

## Project Background

### Techniques, Tools, and Technologies

- Machine Learning Models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). These models have been widely used in time series forecasting tasks and are suitable for analyzing cryptocurrency price data.
- On-Chain Analysis: Leveraging On-Chain metrics to gain insights into transaction activity and utility of cryptocurrencies. On-Chain analytics allows us to examine the behavior and patterns within the Bitcoin blockchain network.
- Python: The programming language used for implementing the machine learning models and data analysis tasks.
- Deep Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch, which provide powerful tools and frameworks for building and training neural network models.
- Data Collection: Gathering historical Bitcoin price data and On-Chain data from reliable sources or APIs.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the collected data for model training and analysis. This step may involve handling missing values, normalizing data, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Evaluation Metrics: Utilizing appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or root mean squared error (RMSE) to assess the performance of the machine learning models.
- Visualization: Visualizing the results, trends, and patterns using libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn.
